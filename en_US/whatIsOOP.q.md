# What is OOP?**
>
**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** - is a programming methodology based on a program representation
as a collection of objects, each of which is an instance of a certain class, and the classes form an inheritance hierarchy.

- object-oriented programming uses objects, rather than algorithms, as the main logical constructive elements;
- each object is an instance of a certain class
- classes form hierarchies.

A program is considered object-oriented only if all three of these requirements are met. In particular, programming,
that does not use inheritance is called not object-oriented, but programming with abstract data types.

According to the OOP paradigm, a program consists of objects that exchange messages.
Objects can have state, the only way to change the state of an object is to send it a message, in response to which,
an object can change its own state.
